👋 Hi, I’m @KaidanTheron
👀 I’m interested in:
-   writing new, innovative software.
-   AI. (super cliche, I know, but seriously.)
-   Embracing the possibilities presented by blockchain technologies.
-   Web Dev and IoT; the internet is the frontier of software and technologies. It will only become more and more important with time.
🌱 I’m currently learning
-   React and React Native
-   Go
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
-   If it's cool, count me in
